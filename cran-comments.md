## Resubmission
This is a re-submission. In this version I have:

* Removed the package name from the description paragraph in DESCRIPTION.
* Increased version number to 0.4.1

## Release summary

This is a re-submission of the first CRAN release of deBInfer.

## Test environments
* OS X 10.9.5 (on travis-ci) R 3.3.1 and R-devel (2016-08-17 r71112)
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.1 and R-devel (2016-09-13 r71247)
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE on win-builder:

* New submission

  Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  MCMC (15:48, 18:19)
  unobservable (12:31)

* The note was for the package being a first-time submission. 
  Furthermore, two words were highlighted as possibly mis-spelled, the first is a common abbreviation that is explained within the description paragraph, the second is a correctly spelled English adjective.
