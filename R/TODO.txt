#TO DO

function that takes deb.mcmc output and simulates means and cred. ints for all state variables and derived variables and plots all state variables.

function that plots posteriors on priors and pair plots of posteriors

foreach wrapper for deb.mcmc to run multiple chains

mcmc setup function should check:
-completeness of parameters
-start values must be in support of corresponding prior (sth like is finite(log_dprior(startvalue, hypers)))

create a set of convenience functions for data simulation from det + obs model
i.e. generalised version of add noise


What's up with the burnin argument in MCMC function?

Store desolve model and obs model in results list

befor starting the actual mcmc the mcmc function should validate a few things:
-does the obs.model have the correct named arguments to pass in data, simulated states and parameters (use formals())

shift current changes into the chytrid version of the mcmc code
