#TO DO

function that takes deb.mcmc output and simulates means and cred. ints for all state variables and derived variables and plots all state variables.

function that plots posteriors on priors and pair plots of posteriors

foreach wrapper for deb.mcmc to run multiple chains

mcmc setup function should check:
-completeness of parameters
-start values must be in support of corresponding prior (sth like is finite(log_dprior(startvalue, hypers)))

create a set of convenience functions for data simulation from det + obs model
i.e. generalised version of add noise
