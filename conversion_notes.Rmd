##Run scripts
run_deb_mcmc.R was moved to /demo as it is not a function per se, but rather a template for how the user should use the package. In the long run this should be re-implemented as a vignette.

##Wishlist
1) A set of functions to extract prior and posterior distributions for parameters and to plot them.
2) A function to print the git output, i.e. parameter estimates and corresponding credible intervals
3) Alternatively make sure MCMC output is coda-compliant

##The DEB model specification

rather than using `dy1, dy2` etc. for the derivatives in the ODE specifications it would be more clear to use the actual notation for the state variables. 

When using deSolve passing in the initial states in a named vector enables propagation of the variable names in the output object which then simplifies plotting etc later
